  <LongDescription># Addresses &amp; Names Mod for Cities Skylines 2
## _Name it all as you wish_

This mod is the successor of the CS1 homonimous mod. It allows changing vanilla methods of name generation to custom name sets.

You can find several name files at [Addresses Files repository at GitHub](https://github.com/klyte45/AddressesFiles). These files will work for both CS1 and CS2 versions of this mod.

**NOTICE:** 
- Surname files are not compatible with the CS2 version. To make them compatible, open the file and remove all text like `{0}` from the file.
- Road qualifier files aren't compatible with CS2.

## Current features

- Edit names of any clickable object in the editor (and save changes to send with the maps created)
- Change sources references for stations names and seeds for roads and districts names in the selected info panel
- In-game filename viewer, showing the weight of each word.
  - Words with a higher weight tends to appear more frequently
  - Raise word weight by creating several lines with same content in the name file.
- Organize your file names using subfolder in the names folder (NEW)
- Choose files to override name generation of:
  - Male cims
  - Female cims
  - Surnames (are last names as default, but may be inverted to follow oriental standard)
  - Dogs (NEW)
  - Roads (Global and by district)
  - Districts
- Roads qualifier rules editor
  - Use ingame UI to create several rules to differentiate streets, avenues, highways, etc by their characteristics
  - Very limited options to customization at this moment, might be enhanced later
- Use district and road names to name your public transport stations!

## Experimental mod warning!
